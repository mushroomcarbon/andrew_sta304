website I made for STA304! v good.

just as an interesting thing that you probably didn't know, uhh more people die from physical overexertion each year than from smoking.

that was a lie - actually, to be precise, I don't even know if its true or not, but I'm willing to take a bet that you probably thought about it as true for at least a moment there.

just to illustrate the power of false data/truths compared to the difficulty in fact-checking (you'd have to go to reputable sources to check both of those stats, then post them in an appropriate manner wouldn't you? whereas I just had to say that one sentence.)

hv a nice day :)
